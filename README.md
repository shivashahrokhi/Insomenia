## About The Project
Insomnia HTTP Client is a Java-based application that provides a user-friendly interface to send HTTP requests, view responses, and manage a list of requests. It is designed to help developers interact with APIs and view their responses in a structured way.

### Features
- **Requests List Panel**: Manage and organize your HTTP requests.
- **Requests Panel**: Configure and send HTTP requests.
- **Responses Panel**: View the server's response to your HTTP requests.
- **Menu Bar**: Access application options, view settings, and get help.
- **System Tray Integration**: Minimize the application to the system tray for quick access.

## Getting Started
To set up the Insomnia HTTP Client on your system:
1. Ensure you have Java installed.
2. Compile the source code using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
3. Run the compiled `MainFrame` class to start the application.

## Usage
Upon launching Insomnia HTTP Client, you will be presented with a three-panel layout:
- The left panel allows you to manage your list of requests.
- The center panel is where you can configure the details of your HTTP requests.
- The right panel displays the server's responses, including headers, status code, size, and response time.

Use the menu bar at the top to navigate through application options, toggle the view settings, or seek help.
